         before you go through javaScript you chould be aware some important keys related to programing and that's why we are here! to teach you the basics of programming and give you a started that make you engaged with upcoming lessons.
           if you are come in with some acquired knowledge from other programing languages like C/C++,Java, python or PHP..., and you want to learn javaScript then go to our first lesson <a href="get-started-with-javascript.html">here</a>. otherwise take some minutes to read this useful introduction.
          </p> 
         <h5 class=" sous-title ml-1 mt-2">1.programming's  meaning</h5>
         <p>A programing as a concept related to program, you probably ask what's a program?
         simply a program is one or more instructions which a computer could execute its. and every instruction is a statement that can do a specific actions.
         for instance:
         <ul class="ml-3 mt-0"> 
         <li>a statement that tell computer to do a mathematics operations like : addition, soustraction, multiplication and division.</li>
         <li>
            a statement that tell computer to write a new value into memory or to read a value that's previously written from memory.
         </li>
         <li>
            a statement that tell computer to open some resources like a file, connect to a database.
         </li>
         <li>a statement that tell computer to write some data to a file/database or read the content of that file or delete it permanently.</li>
         </ul>
         those are the most common task that a computer can did.
               </p>
         <h5 class=" sous-title ml-1">1.machine language</h5>
         <p>Before we are going through JavaScript we should git insights about <mark>programming</mark> what's mean ? 
         what's a <mark>program</mark>? and how I can write and run a program?</p>
         <p>
            Well, when computers appear in 50 era, they was only hundanstand one language which was machine language that has wrote by combining two symbol : <mark>0</mark> and <mark>1</mark> and each combination of these two symbol - we call it a <mark>token</mark> - has a meaning to computer.
         </p>
         <p>
            a sequence of tokens give a specific order to computer wich be for example a mathematical operation like addition and multiplication or be allocation of memory, write a value into memory or reading value resided in memory etc.
         </p>
         <p>
            the examples above of order that can a computer execute(addition, multiplication, allocation, reading, writing)
            we call it elementary operations, and by combining those operations properly we can solve any problem whatever its complexity been.
            for example : sort set of numbers in ascending or descending order,
            search a world in a set of words or text and get it position, analysis a large binary data (image, audio) etc.
         </p>
         machine language is <mark>fastest</mark> and <mark>lightweight</mark> programing language because it directly executed by computer, but it still hard to prospect and maintain by human, it's close to machine hardware and as consequence depend to a specific architecture of processor. this dependency make machine language not portable to other processor architecture, that's mean you should rewriting your program completely if you want to target other architecture processor. that's take a long time and potential especially when a program grow.
         <p>
            <h5 class="ml-1">2.Assembly language</h5>
            the difficulties that come with machine  language drive software architects to work for design and implement a new programing languages that can be easy to read and hundanstand by human, and that's lead to create <mark>Assembly language</mark> wich replace binary tokens(sequences of 0,1) by a meaning words called mnemonics, but those languages inherent non-structured and non-portable aspet from machine language.
            program written by assembly language  become difficult to maintain and read when it scale.
            there are some examples of assembly language remember that're considered <mark>low level programming language</mark>
            as are closed to machine instruction
            <p>
           
            allowing structure program to be efficient and effective. 
            computer science engineers were developed a new programming languages
